# Vue-notepad

A to-do list that is developed based on Vue

-------------------------------

### This is what I did with the Vue-cli based on my original version.

Redefined the CSS style.

The data structure was optimized on a small scale based on the previous version.

Webpack-simple is cited for scaffolding construction.

[note] in the case of clone, please add NPM install to the file, otherwise it will not be resolved, because my time is realized through the moment in node-modules.
